# SillySpammy

SillySpammer is one dumb idea i had, and decided to make a CLI out of it. The CLI has a basic function that waits for user input to locate a text('.txt.') file that will be spammed on a certan number of times thst the user set.

# Installation

1) Open the clone project, and insert the command bellow:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If the command fails, probably you don't have python3 and/or pip in your machine

2) Now run the 'SillySpammy' file using the python command
```
$ python <SillySpammy directory>
```

3) have fun :)
